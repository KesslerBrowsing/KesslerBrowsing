- 👋 Hi, I’m @KesslerBrowsing (also known as R3S0NANCE,Amy, SparkleCat_Crommie, and Detective Cromwell)
- 👀 I’m interested in Killer Bean Forever, Warrior Cats, gaming, literature, art+animation, swimming, and going to Alton Towers+Waterworld.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (mostly at school).
- 💞️ This account is mainly for spectating and following friends, as well as downloading things. I may not post anything at all on here as I do most coding practice on Replit!
:) FranGameTv, Cartoon Low and RedBlaze45 are also very epic! :)
